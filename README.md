# Expense Tracker

A personal expense tracking application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project allows users to track daily expenses, monitor account balances, and visualize spending patterns.

## Project Overview

This application is designed to help users maintain better financial awareness by:
- Tracking individual expenses across different categories
- Monitoring account balances and available funds
- Planning for upcoming payments and expenses
- Visualizing spending patterns over time (in development)

## Current Status

This is a work in progress and personal portfolio project that demonstrates my approach to:
- Component architecture and reusability
- State management in React applications
- TypeScript type safety and organization
- Responsive design principles

## Development Branches

The repository is organized into the following branches:

- **master**: Stable version of the application with core functionality (currently working on js)
